# MemeMe2.0
Udacity iOS Nanodegree MemeMe V2.0

This project focuses on developing skills regarding UIKit - including Navigation Controllers, Tab Bar Controllers, and presenting
view controllers in different ways.

Users can select and image from their photo Library, or camera, and add text and the top or bottom thus creating a Meme. Once saved,
the meme is stored in both a tableView and a CollectionView.

Disclaimer: The data is NOT persisted! So saved images will be deleted upon closing the app
